# Google Sheets Addon Terms of Service and Privacy

## Privacy
The only spreadsheet data we access is the data you choose to send us when you use the FERGIE_FORECAST custom function in Google Sheets.

*All* the data you select as inputs is sent to our servers but nothing else in the spreadsheet is.

Unless you include this information in your input ranges we won't know what the numbers to send us are. E.g. if one of the inputs to FERGIE_FORECAST is profit, we won't know this is what it represents; we only see a column of numbers.

The data you send us may be saved so that we can use it to improve our forecasting algorithms.

Your API key is also sent with every request and this information is also persisted. This helps us monitor usage and prevent abuse.
