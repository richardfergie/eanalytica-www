    <h2 id="machinelearning">Data Science and Machine Learning</h2>

    <p>
        Machine Learning is a big area and Data Science is even bigger! To
        narrow it down; I help people identify places where machine learning can
        be helpful to their organisation and I build custom models and
        algorithms to solve business problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am <em>not</em> a big data specialist &mdash; I will only work with
        "big" data in three circumstances:
        <ol>
            <li>
                It isn't actually that big. There is a useful gap between "too
                big to work with in Excel" and "I need a room full of computers
                to process this" where I can be quite useful.
            </li>
            <li>
                You already have something like BigQuery setup.
            </li>
            <li>
                You want to pay me to learn this stuff. <small>please</small>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a small number of clients where I do data science on non-digital
        data (e.g. offline customer files, charitable interventions) but most of my
        work of this type has digital data at the foundation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="training">Training and Support</h2>
    <p>
        I have been teaching beginners how to use R since 2014 as a part of the
        <a href="https://measurecamp.org/">MeasureCamp</a> series of
        unconferences. If you can't makes the dates for this then I will be happy to
        run a specialised session for you and your organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personalised and more in depth training courses are also popular for
        businesses that already have a small amount of data science expertise. This
        is a great way to empower the clever people in your office by giving
        them a new way to apply their intelligence and creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        A natural follow on from a training course is for me to provide ongoing
        support and troubleshooting for an in house team as they develop their
        skills and processes. "Office hours" when people know they can talk to me
        about this stuff works pretty well but I'm happy to explore other ways of
        collaborating in this space.
    </p>

    <h2 id="webanalytics">Web Analytics</h2>
    <p>
        I provide support and troubleshooting of Google Analytics implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
        From goal tracking to enhanced ecommerce to custom reports for different
        stakeholders I have helped businesses in many areas get the right Google
        Analytics setup for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm slightly biased because I think data has so many applications for
        businesses (and this is how I earn my living), but poor or incomplete web
        analytics setups are a huge missed opportunity for so many people.
    </p>

    <h2>What isn't here?</h2>
    <p>
    <h4 id="ppcmanagement">Paid Search Management</h4>
    <p>
        Paid Search on Google and Bing is where I first started in the industry
        and where I have built a large part of my professional reputation but
        this type of work represents a shrinking proportion of my business as I move
        and develop more in the areas listed above.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reasons for this are interesting and one day I will write a blog post
        about them and link to it from here.
