    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am an independent consultant Data Scientist (since 2015). I can help you use data to improve business processes (faster, cheaper),
        develop new capabilities (training, specialist tools) and to explore new opportunities (machine learning, proofs of concept).

        Most of my clients are <em>in-house analytics teams</em> or <em>digital marketing agencies</em>.
        I am based in Alnwick, Northumberland; from here I can easily get to London by train for face to face meetings but this is a bit too far for day to day work.

    <h3>How I got here</h3>
    <p>
        After my maths degree at Oxford University I was one of the first employees
        at SEOptimise (later White.net - eventually taken over by Found.co.uk).
        I hadn't planned a career in digital but Kevin and Stuart at SEOptimise were
        also offering me the flexibility in my work to do a lot of rowing. The rowing
        thing didn't work out (turns out I'm <em>quite</em> good, but not <em>very</em>
        good) but this gave me an excellent start to my career.
    </p>
    <p>
        I moved to London for a brief stint at Forward3D working on some of the
        biggest paid search accounts in the UK and seeing what life at a bigger
        agency was like. This exposed me to "agile" and the amazing results that a
        joined up process between marketing, design, development and ops can bring.
        This really made me think about how digital can best position itself within
        an organisation which led me to move to Reform; a management consultancy
        which a specialism in digital.
    </p>
    <p>
        My role at Reform was a mix of paid search management, digital analytics and
        management consultancy which is a good intersection to be in for learning. I
        left for two main reasons; that I wanted to leave London
        and I wanted more control over the type of work that I do. I am still
        looking for the right balance between nerdy maths and talking to real
        people.
