<h1>About E-Analytica</h1>
<p>
    E-Analytica is a one man consultancy with expertise in digital measurement
    and its applications in marketing.
</p>
<p>
    The business exists for selfish reasons, namely that I want more control
    over the type of work I was doing and I want to be able to live in
    Northumberland. Since 2015 E-Analytica has enabled me to do both these things
    whilst working with some great clients.
</p>
<p>
    As the only person in the business I can't write about it without writing
    about myself. I <em>love</em> talking about myself but I <em>hate</em>
    writing about myself; something about not knowing the audience I guess. For
    more informations about the "what" rather than the "why" see the
    <a href="/services">Services</a> page.
</p>
<h3>How I got here</h3>
<p>
    After my maths degree at Oxford University I was one of the first employees
    at SEOptimise (now White.net). I never planned a career in digital but Kevin
    and Stuart at SEOptimise were also offering me the flexibility in my work to
    do a lot of rowing. The rowing thing didn't work out (turns out I'm
    <em>quite</em> good, but not <em>very</em> good) but this gave me an
    excellent start to my career.
</p>
<p>
    I moved to London for a brief stint at Forward3D working on some of the
    biggest paid search accounts in the UK and seeing what life at a bigger
    agency was like. This exposed me to "agile" and the amazing results that a
    joined up process between marketing, design, development and ops can bring.
    This really made me think about how digital can best position itself within
    an organisation which lead me to move to Reform; a management consultancy
    for the digital age.
</p>
<p>
    My role at Reform was a mix of paid search management, digital analytics and
    management consultancy which is a good intersection to be in for learning. I
    left for two main reasons listed above, namely that I wanted to leave London
    and I wanted more control over the type of work that I do. I am still
    looking for the right balance between nerdy maths and talking to real
    people.
