        As a mercenary consultant I'll do pretty much anything if you pay me
        enough, but businesses normally engage me for help in the following
        areas:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/services/#ppcmanagement">PPC Management</a></li>
            <li><a href="/services/#ppcaudit">PPC Audit</a></li>
            <li><a href="/services/#machinelearning">Data Analysis and Machine
                Learning</a></li>

        </ul>

    <h2 id="ppcmanagement">Paid Search Management</h2>
    <p>
        Paid Search on Google and Bing is where I first started in the industry
        and where I have built most of my professional reputation. These days it
        represents sllightly less than 40% of my business; this is because it is
        difficult to get a good client fit for ongoing account management for the
        following reasons:
        <ol>
            <li>
                An account must be large enough for me to make a big enough
                difference. For example if I improve a small £1000/month account
                by 15% this is an extra £150/month which will not cover my fee
                let alone provide a good ROI on the engagement for the business
                owner.
            </li>
            <li>
                An account must be small enough that I can manage it by myself.
                A 15% improvement on a £1,000,000/month account is £150,000
                which would provide an excellent return on my fee for the
                business. But it is unlikely that I would be able to do a good
                job of managing an account of this size by myself.
            </li>
            <li>
                The above two points have <em>always</em> been true in the PPC
                industry but over the last few years the quality of automated tooling and
                the quality of new (cheap) graduate entrants into online marketing has
                increased the size of account for which I am good value; there are accounts
                where I can do a good job and more than cover my fee but I don't
                do well enough to differentiate myself from a younger, cheaper person
                working with good automation.</li>
        </ol>
        This means I am a good person to work with on accounts where
        inexperienced practicioners or typical automation tools perform poorly. This
        happens a lot when the goals of the account are not easily captured in web
        analytics tools. For example, an ecommerce store optimising for revenue is
        well served by many automated tools and any PPC practicioner can tell if
        their optimisations are having the desired effect.</p>
    <p>
        A more complicated example where I would expect to have more impact would
        be a hotel looking to increase bookings. There are only a limited number of
        rooms and at some times of year these rooms will sell without any paid
        marketing effort but at other times of year occupancy will be low. The
        challenge is to increase occupancy at the slack times without paying for
        non-incremental bookings at the busy times. Tooling for this problem is not
        well developed (yet).

    <h2 id="ppcaudit">Paid Search Audits</h2>
    <p>
        A lot of the obstacles to finding a good client fit for Paid Search
        Management do not apply for Paid Search Audits. As a one off expense the
        cost can be amortised over a longer period of time which means it is more
        viable for small accounts. And the workload is much easier to plan which
        means that given the right deadline I can audit even the largest of
        accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        And, as a bonus, I <strong>love</strong> digging into new accounts and
        new businesses to figure out how it all works and how it all fits
        together.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have done audits for in house teams and agency teams to provide a fresh
        pair of eyes and some new ideas. I have also audited "from the other side"
        to evaluate agency performance and whether or not the client is getting
        value for money.
