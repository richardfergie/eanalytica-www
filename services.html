        As a mercenary consultant I'll do pretty much anything if you pay me
        enough, but businesses normally engage me for help in the following
        areas:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/services/#machinelearning">Data Analysis and Machine
                Learning</a></li>
            <li><a href="/services/#training">Training and Support</a></li>
            <li><a href="/services/#webanalytics">Web Analytics</a></li>
            <!-- <li><a href="/services/#ppcmanagement">PPC Management</a></li>
            <li><a href="/services/#ppcaudit">PPC Audit</a></li> -->
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id="machinelearning">Data Science and Machine Learning</h2>

    <p>
        Machine Learning is a big area and Data Science is even bigger! To
        narrow it down; I help people identify places where machine learning can
        be helpful to their organisation and I build custom models and
        algorithms to solve business problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am <em>not</em> a big data specialist &mdash; I will only work with
        "big" data in three circumstances:
        <ol>
            <li>
                It isn't actually that big. There is a useful gap between "too
                big to work with in Excel" and "I need a room full of computers
                to process this" where I can be quite useful.
            </li>
            <li>
                You already have something like BigQuery setup.
            </li>
            <li>
                You want to pay me to learn this stuff. <small>please</small>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a small number of clients where I do data science on non-digital
        data (e.g. offline customer files, charitable interventions) but most of my
        work of this type has digital data at the foundation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="training">Training and Support</h2>
    <p>
        I have been teaching beginners how to use R since 2014 as a part of the
        <a href="https://measurecamp.org/">MeasureCamp</a> series of
        unconferences. If you can't makes the dates for this then I will be happy to
        run a specialised session for you and your organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personalised and more in depth training courses are also popular for
        businesses that already have a small amount of data science expertise. This
        is a great way to empower the clever people in your office by giving
        them a new way to apply their intelligence and creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        A natural follow on from a training course is for me to provide ongoing
        support and troubleshooting for an in house team as they develop their
        skills and processes. "Office hours" when people know they can talk to me
        about this stuff works pretty well but I'm happy to explore other ways of
        collaberating in this space.
    </p>

    <h2 id="webanalytics">Web Analytics</h2>
    <p>
        I provide support and troubleshooting of Google Analytics implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
        From goal tracking to enhanced ecommerce to custom reports for different
        stakeholders I have helped businesses in many areas get the right Google
        Analytics setup for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm slightly biased because I think data has so many applications for
        businesses (and this is how I earn my living), but poor or incomplete web
        analytics setups are a huge missed opportunity for so many people.
    </p>

    <h2>What isn't here?</h2>
    <p>
    <h4 id="ppcmanagement">Paid Search Management</h4>
    <p>
        Paid Search on Google and Bing is where I first started in the industry
        and where I have built a large part of my professional reputation but
        this type of work represents a shrinking proportion of my business as I move
        and develop more in the areas listed above.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reasons for this are interesting and one day I will write a blog post
        about them and link to it from here.
    </p>
<!--
        Paid Search on Google and Bing is where I first started in the industry
        and where I have built most of my professional reputation. These days it
        represents slightly less than 40% of my business; this is because it is
        difficult to get a good client fit for ongoing account management for the
        following reasons:
        <ol>
            <li>
                An account must be large enough for me to make a big enough
                difference. For example if I improve a small £1000/month account
                by 15% this is an extra £150/month which will not cover my fee
                let alone provide a good ROI on the engagement for the business
                owner.
            </li>
            <li>
                An account must be small enough that I can manage it by myself.
                A 15% improvement on a £1,000,000/month account is £150,000
                which would provide an excellent return on my fee for the
                business. But it is unlikely that I would be able to do a good
                job of managing an account of this size by myself.
            </li>
            <li>
                The above two points have <em>always</em> been true in the PPC
                industry but over the last few years the quality of automated tooling and
                the quality of new (cheap) graduate entrants into online marketing has
                increased the size of account for which I am good value; there are accounts
                where I can do a good job and more than cover my fee but I don't
                do well enough to differentiate myself from a younger, cheaper person
                working with good automation.</li>
        </ol>
        This means I am a good person to work with on accounts where
        inexperienced practicioners or typical automation tools perform poorly. This
        happens a lot when the goals of the account are not easily captured in web
        analytics tools. For example, an ecommerce store optimising for revenue is
        well served by many automated tools and any PPC practicioner can tell if
        their optimisations are having the desired effect.</p>
    <p>
        A more complicated example where I would expect to have more impact would
        be a hotel looking to increase bookings. There are only a limited number of
        rooms and at some times of year these rooms will sell without any paid
        marketing effort but at other times of year occupancy will be low. The
        challenge is to increase occupancy at the slack times without paying for
        non-incremental bookings at the busy times. Tooling for this problem is not
        well developed (yet).
    </p>

    <h2 id="ppcaudit">Paid Search Audits</h2>
    <p>
        A lot of the obstacles to finding a good client fit for Paid Search
        Management do not apply for Paid Search Audits. As a one off expense the
        cost can be amortised over a longer period of time which means it is more
        viable for small accounts. And the workload is much easier to plan which
        means that given the right deadline I can audit even the largest of
        accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        And, as a bonus, I <strong>love</strong> digging into new accounts and
        new businesses to figure out how it all works and how it all fits
        together.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have done audits for in house teams and agency teams to provide a fresh
        pair of eyes and some new ideas. I have also audited "from the other side"
        to evaluate agency performance and whether or not the client is getting
        value for money.
