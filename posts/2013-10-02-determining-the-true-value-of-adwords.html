<p>
The esteemed Matt Van Wagner wrote a very interesting article on
Search Engine Land titled <a href="http://searchengineland.com/the-ppc-experiment-you-never-dare-run-172325">The PPC Experiment You Never Dare Run</a>. He
describes the PPC nuclear option of turning off all adverts and then
observing the effect on overall revenue.
</p>

<p>
This does help answer the question "Why are we paying for this
traffic? Arenâ€™t we going to get that traffic anyway?" but a couple of
problems spring to mind straight away (I'm sure Matt is aware of
these):
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The nuclear option is not a good one to take; there is a massive
opportunity cost involved in figuring stuff out this way.
</li>
<li>It is not a true experiment because some external event forced the
change: "Campaigns that had been running for a few years were taken
offline abruptly three months ago". This means that the results of
the experiment could be confounded by whatever external factor
caused the campaigns to go offline in the first place. For
example, some companies cut marketing budgets during a recession
and restore them afterwards; in this case we would see site
revenue drop whilst PPC was turned off even if PPC had no overall
impact on the site.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Ebay and paid search effectiveness</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Both of these problems were avoided by Ebay in their March 2013 study
<a href="http://conference.nber.org/confer/2013/EoDs13/Tadelis.pdf">Consumer Heterogeneity and Paid Search Effectiveness: A Large Scale
Field Experiment</a>. Which, in paid search circles, went down only a
little bit better than a house on fire because of the poor impression
it gives of the channel.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether or not Ebay use PPC well I think the
methodology behind the study is excellent. Here are the basic ideas
(details in section 4.1 of the linked document):
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Divide the target geography into separate areas. Ebay used the
Neilsen Designated Market Areas for this.
</li>
<li>Randomly select a subset of these areas to be candidates for the
test. This is done to reduce risk and make this less of a nuclear
option.
</li>
<li>Out of the candidates pair up the areas based on how similar they
are.
</li>
<li>Randomly select one from each pair to be the control and one from
each pair to be the experiment.
</li>
<li>Stop all advertising in the experiment areas.
</li>
<li>Compare the results for these areas with the controls.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For Ebay this resulted in them stopping paid search activity in
roughly 30% of regions which, to me, still seems like quite a high
number; perhaps not the full nuclear option but definitely a dirty
bomb or chemical attack on revenue.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Can we get the rigour without the opportunity cost?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
There will always be some opportunity cost to running this type of
experiment (so weigh the value of the knowledge gained
carefully). But it is possible to run a similar experiment with lower
risk.
</p>

<p>
The variable that determines the risk is the percentage of people who
end up in and experiment area - if you only turn off advertising for
a small mountain village then the opportunity cost is very low. This
must be balanced with getting enough data to be confident about any
conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Here are the levers we can pull:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We control the number of candidates for the experiment. Increasing
this number increases the exposure to risk and decreasing it
reduces the opportunity cost of the experiment.
</li>
<li>Instead of pairing up candidate areas the candidates can be
partitioned into larger groups from which only one is assigned to
the experiment. If candidates are grouped into fives than only 20%
of the candidates end up in the experimental group. This method
also has some extra robustness built in as during the experiment it
is possible to check that the control areas are still similar.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
AdWords makes it easy to prevent ads from running in selected areas
so as far as I can tell these are the only reasons not to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There are more important things to do.
</li>
<li>You are confident in the value of paid search.
</li>
<li>The risk of losing even a small amount of revenue is too much
</li>
<li>Partitioning the areas is hard
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Point number four is probably the only one I can help with - look out
for more information on time series clustering in the future.
