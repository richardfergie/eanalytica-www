title: Goals and Values

<p>
In spite of the title, this post is not about web analytics. Instead
I'm using it to get some thoughts together about why I'm setting up my
own company and what I want it to be.
</p>

<p>
A coach once pointed out to me the importance of aligning your goals
with your values. If your goal is to win an Olympic gold medal and you
value sleeping late at the weekend and spending lots of time with your
family then you're going to have a bad time. This is one of the
reasons I gave up rowing; my values did not align with the sacrifices
I realised I would have to make to reach my goals. I valued the
feeling of being good at rowing too much to accept the beatings I
would need to take to compete at the level I wanted to (it is an
unacknowledged truth in sport that almost everyone loses almost all
the time. 28 people lost in the 100m at London 2012 and you can bet that
a decent proportion of them weren't just happy to be there).
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately it isn't as simple as writing down a list of values and
then finding goals to fit them. As I get older and experience more of
life I realise new things about what I value; either my values are
changing (quite possible) or I'm just not very good at figuring out
what they are.
</p>

<p>
Here are some things that I know I value (as I write them down I
realise they are quite superficial):
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The Feeling of Being Really Good at Something</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Why don't I say "being really good at something"? For two reasons; firstly
because I don't have a lot of experience with being really good at
many things and secondly knowing when you are really good at something
is quite tricky.
</p>

<p>
I am sure that in my life I have definitely been good at two things;
maths and rowing. In both these areas it is possible to measure
yourself against your peers so I have a pretty good idea of where I
stood when I was practising both of them regularly. I would say that
for both, I was at least three standard deviations away from the mean
(i.e. top 1%). However, because I had a pretty good idea of where I
stood in these areas I can estimate that the people who were actually
really good at this stuff were at least another standard deviation
above me in ability. Could I have caught up if I worked harder? Maybe.
</p>

<p>
Would I value being really good at something if I didn't know how good
at it I was? Almost certainly not.
</p>

<p>
Valuing the feeling has two advantages:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It removes the need to figure out some objective ranking mechanism
</li>
<li>I don't need to obsessively compare myself with others in order to
feel fulfilled.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
There is one major downside:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Feeling good isn't the same as being good. I might not push myself
to be as good as I can be.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I'll just have to hope that brutal self honesty keeps me on the
straight and narrow.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> The Feeling of Being Clever</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
A major motivation for me publishing my <a href="http://www.eanalytica.com/blog/tracking-dark-social-with-pushState/">HTML5 pushState analytics hack</a>
is that I knew the community would think it was clever.
</p>

<p>
A weakness of mine is that I don't enjoy some types of work that
deliver excellent results because I don't consider then particularly
clever.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Commitment and intensity of purpose</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
I dislike doing things half arsed. I admire people who exhibit single
minded focus towards a clear vision. When I look back on times in my
life where I have been particularly content I have often been fully
committed to a clear goal.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, when I have been miserable it has often been with the
feeling of not really being fully engaged with what I was doing at the
time.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Making a meaningful impact</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
If you were offered Â£1,000,000/year to stir paint for ten hours a day,
would you take the job? I wouldn't; I have better things to do with my
time and I want whatever I do to have a meaningful impact.
</p>

<p>
Meaningful in this context is hard to define, what separates
meaningful actions from futile ones? I think that for me it is to do
with two things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A close matching between the task and my skills
</li>
<li>Helping someone with values in common with me. This is all about
people; none of this takes place in a vacuum. The main joy of this
type of work is getting good results for a person. For
us both to agree on a definition of "good results" we need to have
something in common.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It's getting late and I also value a good night's sleep. Writing this
post has definitely been useful for me; you might have to put up with
a couple more like this my dear reader.
