        Anchoring is a cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily, or &quot;anchor,&quot; on one trait or piece of information when making decisions

</p><p>I took over a new AdWords account. The click through rates were horrendous. I split tested some adverts and improved the click through rates until I was much happier with them</p><p>Further split testing did not yield big improvement but I was generally pretty happy with how things were going. Later I handed the account over to a colleague a pretty much forgot about it. 6 months down the line she had doubled the click through rate.</p><p>I made two mistakes here, both to do with anchoring:</p><ol><li>I was happy with the improvement I made in the CTR because it was so much better than what I saw initially. My brain &quot;anchored&quot; on the initial CTR and everything else was judged against that. This meant that I did not really consider the possibility that the CTR could be doubled again.</li><li>The adverts that my colleague came up with were completely different to the ones I thought of. I think I was capable of coming up with that idea, but I had &quot;anchored&quot; on my own ad texts as being a template for what would work. I didn't try anything that was really different because I thought I had cracked it. </li></ol><p>Fixing this is tricky. I came up with the following rule (which I do not follow all the time, unfortunately):</p><blockquote><p>Always test at least two adverts. Every fifth advert you test should be completely off the wall. Try and do something that no one else is doing right now.</p></blockquote><p>The problem with this rule is that, whilst it is easy to come up with small tweaks to adverts, it is hard to come up with creative new ideas on a regular basis. It is also tough to force myself to write new ad copy when I know it is <em>probably</em> not going to make more than a 0.01% difference.</p><p> </p><p><em>This post is number 1 in a series.
