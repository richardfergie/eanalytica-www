<p>
At the most recent #MeasureCamp <a href="http://www.clearclues.com">Carmen Mardiros</a> did a presentation on
<a href="http://www.clearclues.com/google-analytics-api-monitor-ecommerce-health/">monitoring ecommerce health</a>. I didn't see this presentation because I
was unable to be at #MeasureCamp but the blog post is interesting,
worth a read, and hopefully gives a complete enough picture of what
she was saying.
</p>

<p>
At #MeasureCamp number two I gave a presentation with some ideas for
marketers to prioritise which areas to investigate by having some
idea of <a href="http://www.eanalytica.com/files/WhatsHappeningMeasureCamp.pdf">what's happening</a>. Combining some of my old ideas from that
presentation with Carmen's more in depth thoughts has lead me to
conclude that accurate forecasts are very important for web analysts
looking to monitor and respond to changes.
</p>

<p>
We look (always along actionable dimensions) for things that are a
bit odd or different; these provide the questions that lead to
insights and improvements. But doing this requires an understanding
of what is normal; what should this value be at this point in time?
</p>

<p>
Good forecasts help provide part of this answer.
</p>

<p>
But making a good forecast is not always that simple.
</p>

<p>
Here is a really simple forecast done with some real visit data (held
in the variable "raw")
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">#load forecast library
library(fpp)
library(ggplot)

#Convert visits data to a timeseries
visits &lt;- ts(raw$Visits, frequency=1)

basicforecast &lt;- forecast(visits)
plot(basicforecast, xlim=c(800,850), xlab="Days", ylab="Visits", main="")
</pre>
</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./files/2013-09-18-basicforecast.png" alt="2013-09-18-basicforecast.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The blue line is the expected value, the dark grey area is an 80%
confidence interval and the light grey area is a 95% confidence
interval.
</p>

<p>
This forecast is pretty much useless as it doesn't even pick up the
obvious weekly seasonality in the data.
</p>

<p>
To make this work better we can pick a more appropriate forecasting
model and help it out by specifying that we are interested in weekly
seasonality.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">visits &lt;- ts(raw$Visits, frequency=7)

weekforecast &lt;- forecast(visits)
plot(weekforecast, xlim=c(110,125), xlab="Weeks", ylab="Visits", main="")
</pre>
</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./files/2013-09-18-weekforecast.png" alt="2013-09-18-weekforecast.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is slightly more useful as the forecast takes into account weekly
trends.
</p>

<p>
Similar methods could be used or more granular tracking; if you
wanted to forecast for Monday morning rather than Monday as a whole
then export the visits data by half day instead of by day and set the
frequency to 14 (as there are 14 half days in a week).
</p>

<p>
One thing that I'm not sure how to do yet is combine different
frequencies. Businesses can have a weekly, monthly and a yearly cycle
and these must be combined for improved forecasting accuracy.
</p>

<p>
Also, as the frequency gets longer problems with limited data and
less significant trends (who has a monthly trend as powerful as their
weekend dip?) cause large uncertainty in the estimates.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">visits &lt;- ts(raw$Visits, frequency=30)

monthforecast &lt;- forecast(visits)
plot(monthforecast, xlim=c(25,31), ylim=c(0,600), xlab="Months", ylab="Visits", main="")
</pre>
</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./files/2013-09-18-monthforecast.png" alt="2013-09-18-monthforecast.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Again, less useful then I hoped.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Next steps</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Hook this model up to the Google Analytics API. Firstly to begin
getting a better idea of its accuracy but also to see how well it
works when the data is filtered across different dimensions.
</li>
<li>Figure out how to combine forecasts with different frequencies so
that everything keeps running smoothly in the event of a bank
holiday or Christmas.
