title: Twitter Network Analysis in R

<p>
One of the most popular posts on here is to do with analysing a social
network and finding the most influential community members:
<a href="http://www.eanalytica.com/blog/pagerank-of-ppcchat-participants/">The PageRank of #PPCChat participants</a> The code for the project was
written in Python, but I've recently written a new version using R. R
is a worse language in my opinion, but the number and variety of
libraries is amazing so it is worth learning.
</p>

<p>
Here is the R source code:
</p>

<p>
Start by loading some libraries. Stringr for regex support and igraph
to do the heavy lifting.
</p>

<p>
Also specify the location where the TSV file of tweet data is stored.
#+BEGIN<sub>SRC</sub> R
library(stringr)
library(igraph)
</p>

<p>
location = "/tmp/data/ppcchat.tsv"
#+END<sub>SRC</sub> R 
</p>

<p>
Load the TSV file. 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE' forces the tweets to be loaded
as a string rather than as a factor. Factor is an R data type for
discrete values.
</p>

<p>
Initialise an empty list of edges.
#+BEGIN<sub>SRC</sub> R
raw &lt;- read.csv("ppcchat.tsv", header=FALSE, sep='\t',stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
edges &lt;- c()
#+END<sub>SRC</sub> R
</p>

<p>
Now iterate through the list of tweets and build a list of edge
pairs. raw$V3 contains the text of all the tweets. raw$V10 contains
the username of the person tweeting.
#+BEGIN<sub>SRC</sub> R
for (i in 1:length(raw$V3)) {
  #Extract the usernames from the tweets
  mentions = unlist(str<sub>extract</sub><sub>all</sub>(tolower(raw$V3[i]),"@[a-z0-9<sub>]</sub>{2,15}"))
  if (length(mentions)!=0) {
    for (j in 1:length(mentions)) {
      if(raw$V10[i]!="" &amp;&amp; substring(mentions[j],2)!="") { #needed for when parser borks
        edges=c(edges,c(tolower(raw$V10[i]),substring(mentions[j],2)))
      }
     }
  }
}
#+END<sub>SRC</sub> R
</p>

<p>
Turn this into an adjacency matrix and create the graph
#+BEGIN<sub>SRC</sub> R
edgematrix &lt;- t(matrix(edges,nrow=2))
g &lt;- graph.edgelist(edgematrix)
#+END<sub>SRC</sub> R
</p>

<p>
I have found that you get far better results from this kind of thing
when loops are removed from the graph. This means ignoring tweets
where a person mentions themselves.
#+BEGIN<sub>SRC</sub> R
for (i in 1:length(g[,1])){
  g[i,i] = 0
}
#+END<sub>SRC</sub> R
</p>

<p>
Finally, calculate PageRank and return the top ten
#+BEGIN<sub>SRC</sub> R
pr&lt;-page.rank(g,directed=TRUE)
topten &lt;- sort(pr$vector,decreasing=TRUE)[1:10]
#+END<sub>SRC</sub> R
</p>
