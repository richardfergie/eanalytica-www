title: Using HTML5 and pushState to track "dark social"
tags: analytics
---

<p>
I first read the phrase "dark social" in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dark-social-we-have-the-whole-history-of-the-web-wrong/263523/">an article in the
Atlantic</a>. The author (Alexis Madrigal) correctly points out that a lot
of social content sharing is not tracked by web analytics because it
shows up as direct traffic. I don't think this means "we have the
whole history of the web wrong" but it is something to ponder.
</p>

<p>
For other channels where there is a high chance of a visitor arriving
without a referrer string web analysts use URL tagging to decide where
they have come from. This required tagging the URLs in advance so it
works very well for things like email where everything is under
control. It doesn't work so well for social media where you can't rely
on people tagging your URLs for you (and you certainly can't rely on
them not to do it in a malicious way).
</p>

<p>
The social share buttons on the blog use URL tagging so that when
someone uses them to share a post I can tell that everyone who clicks
the link clicked a link that was originally shared that way. My next
thought was to customise the share URL for each user with a unique
identifier so that I could tell who shared content most
successfully. Linking up a person with the unique identifier could be
tricky but it wouldn't be impossible.
</p>

<p>
But the most common method of sharing is to copy and paste from the
address bar; it is impossible to tag these URLs 
without some kind of crazy server side wizardry. Right?
</p>

<p>
The pushState API is part of HTML5 designed to enable faster,
interactive websites. It allows manipulation of the URL in the URL bar
without reloading anything from the server. Rob Ousbey did a good
introduction over on <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/create-crawlable-link-friendly-ajax-websites-using-pushstate">SEOMoz</a>. We can use this to append tracking
parameters to a URL. Press the green button to see it in action:
</p>

<script>
function addTrackingParameters() {
    if (history.pushState) { //feature detection
        var currentURL = window.location.href;
        var trackingParams = '?utm_src=UNIQUE_USER_ID&utm_medium=browserbar';
        var newURL = currentURL + trackingParams;
        window.history.pushState(null, document.title, newURL);
    }
    else {
        alert("Your browser does not support the pushState API");
    }
}
</script>
<button class="btn-large btn-success" onclick="addTrackingParameters();">Add tracking parameters</button>

<p>
So now, when you copy and paste this URL to share my awesome post with
your friends I will be (or would be if I had bothered to configure a
unique ID for you) able to see what influence this has.
</p>

<p>
The code used here is simple and has obvious bugs that mean it won't
work in several real work situations.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-:exports">&lt;script&gt;
function addTrackingParameters() {
    if (history.pushState) { //feature detection
        var currentURL = window.location.href;
        var trackingParams = '?utm_src=UNIQUE_USER_ID&amp;utm_medium=browserbar';
        var newURL = currentURL + trackingParams;
        window.history.pushState(null, document.title, newURL);
    }
    else {
        alert("Your browser does not support the pushState API");
    }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</div>
