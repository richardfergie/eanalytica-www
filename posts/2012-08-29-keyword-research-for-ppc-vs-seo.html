Yesterday Jenny Halaz wrote a piece on Search Engine Land about
the <a href="http://searchengineland.com/the-difference-in-keyword-research-for-seo-vs-ppc-131186">different approaches to keyword research for PPC and SEO</a>. She
makes some excellent points but I really disagree with her about the
relative size of the margin for error in each discipline.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The Margin for Error in PPC</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

Jenny says
</p>
<blockquote>
the margin for error in PPC is small. Every mistake costs you money.
</blockquote>
<p>
And it is true, every PPC mistake does cost you money. But this is
also true of SEO even if the cost is only opportunity cost.
</p>

<p>
However, the key thing about PPC is the speed at which you can learn
and react. If I add some bad keywords or end up targeting the wrong
area then I'll know about it pretty quickly. I can also fix my mistake
because changing PPC keywords and adding new ones is fast.

<p>
Contrast this with SEO&#x2026;

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> The Margin for Error in SEO</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
In the SEO projects I have worked on there have been two major
difficulties:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Getting changes and recommendations onto the live site
</li>
<li>Linkbuilding
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Both of these tasks depend on the keyword research, and for both of
them learning that the keyword research is wrong may require starting
again from scratch.
</p>

<p>
The costs here could be massive both in terms of all the missed search
traffic while these things are being implemented (again) and in terms
of the time taken by IT teams and linkbuilders.
</p>

<p>
I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb with what I say in this
post. For years people have known that one of the best ways PPC and
SEO can work together is to use PPC to help the SEO team with their
keyword research:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>SEO team go to PPC team with an idea of the keywords they want to
bid on (or they setup the PPC themselves)
</li>
<li>PPC team dedicate a small testing budget to these keywords
</li>
<li>PPC team report to SEO team on keyword performance, in terms of
volume of impressions, quality of traffic and competitiveness of
auction
</li>
<li>SEO team analyses the data and may go back to step 1 with a new set
of keywords.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This approach does not require expensive (in terms of time)
linkbuilding or on site changes. I cannot imagine anyone doing it the
other way around (SEO team run experiments to tell PPC team what to
bid on) which is why I think it is so odd for Jenny Halasz to say that
there is more risk in PPC keyword research than SEO
