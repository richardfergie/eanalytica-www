No one loves client reporting and everyone wants a better way of doing
it. What would my perfect client reporting tool look like?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Automatic data export. No more exporting data in one format just to
copy and paste it into another.
</li>
<li>Flexible. I'm not a huge fan of inflexible report
templates. Sometimes I want to show something else, or highlight
the performance of a particular campaign without have to rewrite
the whole template.
</li>
<li>PDF export. .xls(x) is the file format of the analyst. HIPPOs like
.pdf (probably so they can print it out).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I've never found anything that fitted all of these criteria but now
I'm starting to think I might have found something.

<a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/">Org-babel</a> is an extension to <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> which lets you run code as you
write documents. I can combine this with the amazing graph drawing
capabilities of R and the Google Analytics API to start producing
pretty sweet reports without tiresome data munging.

Matt Clarke over at TechPad has a good guide to
<a href="http://techpad.co.uk/content.php?sid=220">getting started with R and the Google Analytics API</a>. One part of the
article is out of date (unless Matt has updated the post); the Google
Analytics library he links to is out of date after the latest API
changes. Instead you can use the one at
<a href="https://github.com/JerryWho/rgoogleanalytics">https://github.com/JerryWho/rgoogleanalytics</a> (works for me
anyway). You'll also need an GA API key too.

Putting the following code in an org file will get the visits and
pageviews per day for a site and then draw a fancy graph of them:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-:exports">#+name: visits-pageviews-graph
#+begin_src R :file /files/2012-09-24-pageviews.png :exports results :results output graphics :width 700 :height 400
  library(rgoogleanalytics)
  library(ggplot2)
  ga &lt;- RGoogleAnalytics()
  ga$SetCredentials("LOGIN_EMAIL", "PASSWORD", "API_KEY")
  query &lt;- QueryBuilder("API_KEY")
  query$Init(start.date=Sys.Date()-30,
           end.date=Sys.Date()-1,
           dimensions="ga:date",
           metrics="ga:visits,ga:pageviews",
           sort="ga:date",
           table.id="PROFILE_ID")
  ga.data &lt;- ga$GetReportData(query)
  d&lt;-data.frame(ga.data$data)
  d$ga.date &lt;- as.Date(d$ga.date,"%Y%m%d")
  pageviews &lt;- d$ga.pageviews
  qplot(d$ga.date, d$ga.visits,xlab="Date",ylab="Visits", size=pageviews, color=pageviews)

It is then quite simple to write the insightful commentary that should
be the most time consuming part of reporting.

The resulting report can then be exported to PDF directly. In order to
get a stylish and good looking result at the end you'll have to style
the template using LaTeX - this might be a bit much! I haven't got
this far yet; I might try my hand at some templates in the future.

If you don't want to use org-mode there is an R package called <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>
that can do the same thing. I prefer org-mode for the ease of editing
text, but knitr integrates more closely with R.
