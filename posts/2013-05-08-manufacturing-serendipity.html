<p>
A phrase that I'm hearing crop up these days is "manufacturing
serendipity". At the moment I mainly hear this from Rand Fishkin and
Will Critchlow, although knowing these two the whole world will be
using it within the next two year.
</p>

<p>
Rand describes it in a <a href="http://moz.com/rand/manufacturing-serendipity/">post on his personal blog</a> as:
</p>

<blockquote>
This manufacturing serendipity business breaks down pretty much like this:
<ol>
<li>Go to places that are not your office (conferences, events, meetups, trains, etc)</li>
<li>Participate in things, learn things, and be generally game for new experiences</li>
<li>Meet interesting people in the process</li>
<li>Build relationships</li>
<li>Be generally awesome by helping the people youâ€™ve met and doing good deeds with no expectation of a return</li>
<li>Repeat 1-5 hundreds of times</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
To me this process seems unquantifiable and high risk. Any method for
success is difficult to evaluate because of survivor bias where only
those who have used a method successfully but "manufacturing
serendipity" seems particularly dodgy to me.
</p>

<p>
Another word for serendipity is "luck". The process of manufacturing
serendipity involves working very hard for a number of year until you
get lucky. There is nothing really very new to this but it does raise
the following questions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What activities can I undertake to maximise my luck for the same
amount of work?
</li>
<li>How do I know if this is working? How can I be sure that in five
years time I will be reaping the benefits of what I'm putting in
now?
</li>
<li>Is there something else I can do that will give a better or faster
payoff for the same (or less) work?
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Similar questions can be asked about anything, but because of the
long and uncertain payoff schedule for manufacturing serendipity
these issues are particularly pertinent.
</p>

<p>
By creating thousands of opportunities, each with a tiny chance of
success it is very hard (even with hindsight) to evaluate the
effectiveness of actions. 
</p>

<p>
To quantify this and evaluate the strategy against others we will
have to estimate a per interaction chance of success within a time
period. Lets suppose that each time you attempt to manufacture
serendipity you have a 1% chance of receiving a payoff in the next
five years (personally, I think this is high).
</p>

<p>
If you can manage 100 times a year (i.e. twice(ish) a week) then you
can expect one of these to payoff within the next five years. Remember
that the value of this payoff should be discounted because it is
better to have the money now rather than later.
</p>

<p>
Now you can evaluate the expected payoff from manufacturing
serendipity against alternatives.
</p>

<p>
Trust to luck? I'd rather think about the numbers first.
