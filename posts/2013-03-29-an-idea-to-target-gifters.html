<p>
Some products are often bought as gifts. In this case, the demographic
for the buyers can be quite different to the demographic who are
interested in the site.
</p>

<p>
It can be quite difficult to use search to target these people; they
don't know a lot about the type of product they are buying so the
search volume tends to cluster around a smaller number of competitive
head terms.
</p>

<p>
Here is a quick idea for targeting the people buying the gifts:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use interest targeting for whichever niche the product is in.
</li>
<li>Combine this with category targeting for a category likely to be
frequented by the gift buyer.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The idea here is to reach the computer used by the receiver of the
gift whilst it is in use by the purchaser of the gift. The receiver
browses sites in the relevant niche so Google identifies the browser
as belonging to someone with that interest. Then when the gift buyer
is browsing sites that interest them then they will see your ads.
