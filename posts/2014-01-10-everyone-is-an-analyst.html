<p>
TL;DR; use your web analytics expertise to unlock the domain
expertise of the client
</p>

<p>
As I'm sure anyone with a LinkedIn profile and web analytics as a
skill knows there is a bit of a skills gap in organisations when it
comes to analysing their data.
</p>

<p>
So businesses hire analysts and, depending on how well they can hire,
reports or actionable insights (or possibly both) are produced. The
assumption here is that it is only the analyst who has the skills and
ability to use the data to produce these reports or insights; they
have been hired because these skills are lacking in the organisation.
</p>

<p>
A few projects I've had recently and the strategy I'm developing for
another client make me question the usefulness of this assumption.
</p>

<p>
I don't think that most people are idiots when it comes to web
analytics. Most idiotic behaviour arises from a complete lack of web
analytics domain knowledge combined with an attempt to guess the
solution whilst stating the problem.
</p>

<p>
On the flip side, new analysts completely lack of domain knowledge
for the organisation they are working with. This leads to reporting
on metrics that don't matter and impractical solution suggestions to
unimportant problems. I know this is true; I've done it myself.
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned earlier, the traditional solution to this is for the
analyst to learn the problem domain and then to provide insight. The
alternative, which I think is the way things are going, is for the
web analytics expert to build tools so that the client's lack of web
analytics knowledge doesn't block them from using their organisation
domain knowledge to perform their own analysis.
</p>

<p>
Google Analytics custom reports are an example of this trend; the
analyst uses their domain expertise enable to client to use their
domain expertise without the client having to learn lots about Google
Analytics.
</p>

<p>
An interesting corollary to this idea is that unless your client is
interested only in what can be reported in Google Analytics you will
have to learn how to integrate with other systems. This is part of
the trend where I think web analytics will be absorbed by business
intelligence within the next 10 years.
</p>

<p>
This is a big step up in complexity from making Custom Reports. The
introduction of Universal Analytics might help plug the gap here, but
all it really does is shift the work away from creating the report
and onto getting the collectors implemented correctly.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
It should maybe be a different blog post to talk about ways to enable
analysis for a non-domain expert outside of custom reports but I blog
so infrequently that I'm going to stick it in here whilst I'm in flow.
</p>

<p>
What is the difference between an analysis tool and a report? There
isn't a clear dividing line but I'd say the main differences are that
a report is less flexible and less subtle. A report presents and
justifies a conclusion that is already decided; a tool enables the
user to find their own conclusion (although the sort of conclusion
they might want to find can be built in).
</p>

<p>
Where to start with building tools? The first question is to figure
out what analysis you want to enable. Then select the tools necessary
to do this.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Excel. Whatever tool you make, the data is probably going to end up
in Excel anyway so why not skip the middleman and put it directly
in this format? A good Excel workbook for analysis is not the same
as a good Excel report; for example, things like whether a field is
in a row or a column suddenly become much more important when the
end user is going to be trying to mung it about
themselves. Probably the only option in many cases.
</li>
<li>Third party tools. If you have the budget there are many, many
awesome tools designed for exactly this sort of thing. I've only
briefly used <a href="http://www.qlikview.com">Qlikview</a> but I was very impressed. A good place to get
an idea of what kind of tools are out there and how they might be
integrated is the <a href="http://www.snowplowanalytics.com/blog.html">Snowplow blog</a> which frequently has posts on
integrating new frontends and visualisations with their data
backend.
</li>
<li>Web Applications. For my client <a href="http://www.keyfund.org.uk">Keyfund</a> I've increased the number
of analysts by a factor of 10 (potentially a factor of 100 if we
roll the tool out further) by presenting a small amount of data
on top of Google Maps. This is a big deal because the two main
bottlenecks with Keyfund are my lack of time and my lack of domain
knowledge. I'm also finding that <a href="http://filter.eanalytica.com">http://filter.eanalytica.com</a> is
saving me enough time that I'm ROI positive from making it with me
as the only user.

</ul>

<p>
When you think about it this way there is actually a hierarchy of
enablers:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I create a custom report which enables the client
</li>
<li>In doing so I'm enabled by the Google Analytics web interface
</li>
<li>I'm also enabled by <a href="https://twitter.com/fastbloke">Doug Hall</a> who has written some javascript that
helps me track something I wouldn't otherwise be able to
</li>
<li>Doug's javascript uses jquery
</li>
<li>&#x2026;
</li>
<li>Turing came up with the idea for a universal computer
</li>
</ol>

<p>
At level X something is created using domain specific knowledge of
level X which can then empower those on the level X-1 to use their
domain specific knowledge.
</p>

<p>
I am slightly reminded of <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a> which
you should definitely have a look at if you haven't seen it already.
</p>

<p>
So in conclusion, you are at your most powerful when you enable
others to use your domain knowledge to better use their domain knowledge.
