title: Data = Truth?

<p>
Today I observed a Twitter conversation between <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielJTruman">Daniel Truman</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/kelvinnewman/">Kelvin Newman</a> during which Kelvin (perhaps light-heartedly) asked the
following question:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" width="500"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DanielJTruman">@DanielJTruman</a> data = truth ?</p>&mdash; kelvin newman (@kelvinnewman) <a href="https://twitter.com/kelvinnewman/statuses/366934581145911297">August 12, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>
Is this actually the case?
</p>

<p>
Firstly, data cannot be false but this doesn't mean it is necessarily
the truth. 
</p>

<p>
I'd liken it to the shadows on the wall of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">Plato's Cave</a>; data is only
a projection of reality. 
</p>

<p>
I'm quite happy with this analogy:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can get a far more accurate picture of what is actually
happening if you can rotate or move the object and see how the
projected shadow changes. This is similar to how running
experiments or seeing the effect of actions on a data set makes
reasoning about cause and effect more robust.
</li>
<li>The projection could be a massive distortion of reality.
</li>
<li>People who see different projections of the same object will
interpret things differently.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I <i>think</i> it is possible to uniquely identify a 3D object given
enough projections but in real life the objects are complicated and
there is never enough data. 
</p>

<p>
So is data the truth? No; it is a representation of it.
