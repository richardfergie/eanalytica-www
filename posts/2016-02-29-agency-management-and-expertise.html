title: Agency Management and Expertise
---

<p>
Last week I enjoyed reading Andrew Goodman's SEL piece on
<a href="http://searchengineland.com/death-search-marketing-expertise-242628">The Death of Search Marketing Expertise</a>. For those of you who haven't read it,
Andrew laments the lack of knowledge/expertise among modern agency owners.
</p>

<p>
Andrew's hypothesis is that this is a result of agency owners caring more about
the growth of their business than the "craft" (my word) of marketing. Which I
think is probably true. 
</p>

<p>
This leads to a worse level of service for the agency's clients because the
owner sets the culture. So the employees of the agency don't get the mentorship
and development they need to grow in their roles.
</p>

<p>
On Twitter, my "in group" are PPCers who are at the "craftsman" end of the
spectrum (out of the industry as a whole this is a minority). Andrew's piece is
like catnip for us because the "clueless idiot who makes a tonne more money
than me" is always a good out group to position against.
</p>

<p>
But no matter how much we dislike it, I think the clueless agency owner is here
to stay:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Assume there is no relationship between PPC ability and ability to run an
agency. If you plotted these two axes on a chart (too lazy to actually do this
for you - sorry) you wouldn't see any correlation.
</li>
<li>Now assume that to be successful as an agency owner your agency running
skills + your PPC skills must be above a threshold. i.e. if you have AMAZING
PPC skills you don't need to be very good at running an agency or vice
versa. This assumption is false, but might be useful
</li>
<li>Exclude everyone below this threshold. Going back to our imaginary
scatterplot, this removes everyone below a line that slopes down from the top
left to bottom right
</li>
<li>Among all the people remaining there is a negative correlation between
PPC ability and agency running ability. (!!)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Asking if this is good or bad for the industry is like asking if the spinning
jenny was good or bad for the weaving industry in the 18th century.
</p>

<p>
The industrialisation of textile manufacture was bad for artisan weavers
(i.e. all weavers prior to about 1740) but it lead to a much larger industry and
cheaper/better cloth for consumers.
</p>

<p>
PPC is now out of the genesis phase and is moving towards
commodotisation. People like me are trying to convince clients that they need
"artisanal PPC" delivered by a craftsman - in some cases this might even be
true. And I honestly believe that there will <b>always</b> be a market for this kind
of service <b>but</b> it is currently a shrinking market.
</p>

<small>I'm perhaps abusing the word "craftsman" here. The origin of the word
refers to people who have done a 5-9 year apprenticeship and at least one year
as a journeyman.</small>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The pressure towards a commodotised service is inevitable, but for PPC the
change is accelerated by the engines. "Commodotise your complements" is good
strategy and one of the complements of a robust search advertising revenue
stream is a whole bunch of agencies to help clients spend their money.
</p>

<p>
Comparing PPC and SEO is illustrative here - I think the commoditisation of SEO
is happening and is inevitable but the pace is a lot slower because it is not
being driven by the search engines. If anything, changes to the algorithm over
the last few years have made the commodotised approach less effective.
