title: Interest and Category Targeting for Fun and Profit

<p>
Interest and category targeting have been around for a while now in
AdWords. I've had an idea on how they can be usefully combined which
I will share in this post.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Interest targeting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
As a user browses sites that run AdSense Google is able to build up a
picture of what that user is interested in. Google then groups these
users into categories and allows advertisers to target them in
AdWords using interest targeting.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Category targeting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Interest targeting <i>aims</i> to target users (below I will talk about
how this is not actually the case) but category targeting works at
the page level; Google figures out into which categories a page fits
and then allows advertisers to target these categories.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Performance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
I find both of these targeting methods to be generally less effective
(when measured in terms of direct response) than the keyword based
contextual targeting.
</p>

<p>
However it is easier to establish a much wider reach using these
targeting methods and there is a lot of cheap inventory so it is
possible to get lower CPCs. However, be at least slightly wary of the
quality of these sites; a colleague of mine once put it rather well:
</p>
<blockquote>
There is a physical limit to the number of these sites that I can
block in a day, but there is no limit to the amount of shit on the
internet.
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> In combination</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
There are interesting possibilities for combining interest and
category targeting.
</p>

<p>
For a not signed in user (I believe there are still some of them
around) the user's interests are based on a cookie so it is not the
user that is actually being targeted but the browser. Thus if two
people share a browser you will end up targeting both of them.
</p>

<p>
Normally this would be considered a bad thing but let me present to
you the following scenario:
</p>

<p>
You run an online shop selling products for women. However, this
product is often bought as a gift so only about 50% of your customers
are women. Search advertising works well, but the type of keyword
that performs well (very specific queries) are unlikely to be used by
men buying gifts because these people don't know the level of detail
necessary to make these queries; how can we target them?
</p>

<p>
One solution is to combine interest targeting with category or
contextual targeting.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Target and interest closely related to the product. This will
target the browsers used by people who might buy directly.
</li>
<li>Combine it with category targeting of the gifter audience; in this
case it could be something like "Football"
</li>
<li>Write adverts suggesting <b>he</b> purchases a gift; you could get
quite creepy with this.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
By picking categories and interests with a small or non existent
overlap it is possible to target one user of a browser based on the
activities or preferences of another.
