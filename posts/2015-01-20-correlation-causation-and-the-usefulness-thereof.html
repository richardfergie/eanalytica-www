title: I have no idea what to call this post
tags: causation, correlation
---

<p>
This is actually a fitting title for the following piece of mental
spew because the title of a <a href="http://moz.com/blog/seo-correlation-causation">recent Moz article</a> got me slightly riled
up. The substance of the blog post is far more resonable - but the
title does not do a very nuanced area justice. So in my own response I
am not committing to a title out of cowardice.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Correlation is not causation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
<i>Correlation is not causation</i> has become a bit of a cliche in the SEO
world. The statement is true - I am not going to dispute that. But I
would add to it that, from a business perspective, correlation is only
<i>interesting</i> as far as it says something about causation.
</p>

<p>
The whole point of doing analysis of data for business is to come up
with something where changing it will improve the business. Acting on
spurious correlations
(e.g. <a href="http://www.tylervigen.com/view_correlation?id=7">a Cheese business building their strategy around increasing the
number of deaths from bedsheet tangles</a>) does not change business
outcomes.
</p>

<p>
To say the same thing again in a different way; businesses need to
find factors that they can manipulate that <b>cause</b> a change in
business outcomes. The existence (or not) of a correlation can provide
evidence for this kind of relationship which is why correlations are
worth looking at but if there is not causative relationship then
finding a correlation is a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
This is my main disagreement with what Rand is saying; if there is no
causation then the relationship is not useful. 
</p>

<p>
I suspect this is because we haven't defined clearly enough what we
mean by "cause". But that is a whole minefield that I am completely
not qualified to get into.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Proxy metrics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Google want to send searchers to the best site for the searcher/query
combination. "Best" here is very difficult to define. Google's initial
success was because they used PageRank (combined with onpage factors)
as a <b>proxy metric</b> for "best". It was a closer proxy than what other
search engines were using at the time so Google's results were better.
</p>

<p>
Problems come along when the proxy metric get separated from the true
goal. This happened with PageRank when people began buying links,
setting up link wheels etc. (this last statement could be completely
false - it is true that old quality signals became divorced from
"best" but <i>why</i> this happened I don't know enough about old SEO to
say). So search engines found other proxies that were more closely
linked with what the "best" pages were.
</p>

<p>
This dance of engines building better proxy metrics and SEOs
divorcing the proxy from true quality has gone on for many years. Some
say this is coming to an end with the ongoing success of Panda and
Penguin but others disagree.
</p>

<p>
Rand advises that modern SEOs do not try to discover what metrics
search engines are currently using to proxy for quality and, where
such proxy metrics are known, to ignore them. On a much broader scale
this describes the shift in SEO over the past years from "exploiting"
the algorithm to making great businesses that deserve to rank (i.e. by
aiming straight for the mythical "best" rather than by trying to game
the system).
</p>

<p>
I don't do enough SEO to comment on this from first hand
experience. But I will make the following points:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A business that invests resources in becoming the "best" in their
niche will suffer if their definition of "best" is not expressed in
whatever proxy metrics the search engines are using at the moment
</li>
<li>Telling people that all they need to do is be awesome and that then
glory and rankings will follow is not very useful advice. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I can't write a post on causation without drawing a directed, acyclic
graph.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this is a bit of a bastardised one because the nodes
are so vaguely defined but I think it will suffice to get my point
across.
</p>

<p>
This diagram says that the true quality of a page, combined with the
Google engineers who make the algorithm determine what the "proxy
metric" value of the page is. This then determines the page rankings.
</p>

<p>
Rand says ignore the proxy metrics and aim directly for true
quality. I can understand this stance because the Google engineers
aren't stupid so gaming proxy metrics can have a short lifespan.
</p>

<p>
But there is still a causal relationship between true quality and
rankings, it is just mediated by proxy metrics. If Rand disagrees with
this definition of causation and says that only proxy metrics cause
rankings then this is our point of disagreement. And given this
definition of causation I agree with what he is saying.

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Determining Causal Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The gold standard for determining a causal relationship is the
randomised controlled trial. Doing these tends to be a bit of a joke
in the SEO industry (happy to be directed to examples that prove
otherwise) but there are other, lower, standards of proof that can
still be useful.
</p>

<p>
There are ways that causal relationships can be estimated from raw
data with little or no human input (e.g. <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/figures/1752-0509-1-37-3-l.jpg">this chart</a> with <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/1/37">accompanying
paper</a>) but I don't know anyone doing this in a marketing
context. <a href="https://plus.google.com/109159729997909875172/posts/3jsEYkzFJTd">I've
tried on the Moz ranking factors data</a> but I haven't had much luck
getting anything useful out of it (I think this is because assumptions
of normally distributed data are not at all reasonable in this
domain).
</p>

<p>
Either way, inferring a causal relationship between ranking and some
other <b>manipulable</b> factor is bloody hard work. And perhaps this is a
reason why Rand suggests focussing on correlations instead - with the
data Moz has these are much easier to discover.
</p>

<p>
But this doesn't mean that causative relationships don't exist and it
doesn't negate my first point:

Businesses need to find factors that they can manipulate that <strong>cause</strong> a change in business outcomes - <em>me (earlier in this post)</em>
