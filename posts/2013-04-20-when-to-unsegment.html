title: When Do You Unsegment/Aggregate?

<p>
Averages lie so one of the best ways to improve the efficiency of a
PPC account is to use more granular segmentation.
</p>

<p>
In this example the average overvalues segment one and undervalues
segments two and three. By restructuring the account to allow
targeting on segments two and three separately from segment one
efficiency can be improved.
</p>

<p>
In 2012 I did this for some of my travel clients; separating London
out by creating geo-targeted campaigns. The value of London traffic
is normally higher because London has wealthier people but in this
case the effect was exaggerated because of the Olympics. Running ads
like "escape the city this August" was a highly targeted message for
this audience and the campaigns performed well. 
</p>

<p>
So now I have a lot of London specific campaigns kicking around. And
they still perform better than the overall average, but the delta is
much smaller now. If London were still grouped in with everything
else I certainly wouldn't segment it into a separate campaign now;
the difference in performance isn't big enough. But it feels wrong to
merge campaigns together again; I spend so much time thinking about
segmentation that I've never considered when to aggregate things back
together again.
</p>

<p>
This is something that I should give more thought to; PPC is a
dynamic enviroment. I have appreciated for some time that dimensions
occasionally perform differently enough that segmentation is worth
the extra effort. But I've never thought about when to go the other
way.
