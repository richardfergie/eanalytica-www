title: One (of Many) Problems With Attribution Rules
tags: attribution
---

<p>
Currently attributing revenue between multiple touch points on a
user's journey to purchase involves using some kind of rule to split
the credit up based on the order in which touch points occur. Example
rules are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Last click
</li>
<li>First click
</li>
<li>Equal split (each touch point gets equal credit)
</li>
<li>Some other order based split e.g. first touch gets 50% with even
weighting for the other touch points.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can also add channel specific rules:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If AdWords is involved at any stage it gets 100% of the credit
(i.e. the AdWords conversion tracking rule)
</li>
<li>After a brand channel is used and subsequent touch points get 0%
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This type of rule doesn't help with the strawman I'm building here so
I'm going to revisit them later.
</p>

<p>
Now we are going to make some simplifying assumptions about a
hypothetical online business. These assumptions will be used to make a
model which is easy to reason about and experiment with.
</p>

<p>
Here are the rules:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Users can only arrive at the site through search, display or
social. No distinction will be made between brand and non-brand
search.
</li>
<li>Every user visits the site exactly three times before either
purchasing or vanishing forever.
</li>
<li>If a user visits the site through display on any one of their three
visits then they will convert on their last visit.
</li>
<li>If a user never arrives via display then they will never convert.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So the path to purchase/vanishing for ever looks like this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-dot" id="user-paths"> digraph G {
  size="8,6"
  ratio=expand
  display1[label="display"]
  display1-&gt;display2
  display1-&gt;search2
  display1-&gt;social2
  search1[label="search"]
  search1-&gt;display2
  search1-&gt;search2
  search1-&gt;social2
  social1[label="social"]
  social1-&gt;display2
  social1-&gt;search2
  social1-&gt;social2
  display2[label="display"]
  display2-&gt;display3
  display2-&gt;social3
  display2-&gt;search3
  search2[label="search"]
  search2-&gt;display3
  search2-&gt;search3
  search2-&gt;social3
  social2[label="social"]
  social2-&gt;display3
  social2-&gt;search3
  social2-&gt;social3
  display3[label="display"]
  display3-&gt;conversion
  search3[label="search"]
  search3-&gt;conversion
  search3-&gt;vanish
  social3[label="social"]
  social3-&gt;conversion
  social3-&gt;vanish
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Another assumption:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At each visit a user is equally likely to use any one of the three
channels.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Next we put 6000 people in at the top of the funnel (2000 in each
channel). What happens next?
</p>

<p>
At each step a user has a 2/3 chance of not using display so after the
third interaction (2/3)<sup>3</sup>=8/27=30% (approx) will not have clicked a
display advert. By our assumption that a user converts if and only if
they interact with display we get 4200 conversions in total.
</p>

<p>
There are 27 different ways of interacting with the three channels
over three visits.
</p>

<p>
Let's apply a few attribution models to these results and see what
they tell us:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First click: Each channel is attributed with 1400 conversions
</li>
<li>Last click: 19 of our 27 paths convert and of these, nine have
display as the last interaction. So display gets attributed with
9/19 of the conversions (1990 approx). By symmetry the other
conversions are split equally between search and social (1105 each).
</li>
<li>Even attribution: On our 19 converting paths there are 57
interactions (multiply!). Display represents 27 of these with search
and social being 15 each. So under this model display gets 27/57 of
the credit, 1990 conversions, with search and social each having
1105 conversions each.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All these models are poor because they attribute credit to channels
that don't deserve it. The correct model in this case is to attribute
100% of the credit to display.
</p>

<p>
The question is, how do we know that this is the right thing to do
without knowing what the model is? How can we see that display is the
only channel causing conversions just by looking at the user path
data?
</p>

<p>
And don't forget, that this is an easy example; anything that touches
display converts. The problem gets a lot harder when things are less
black and white.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Further things to consider</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I said right at the start that I was constructing a strawman argument
and I think I've been quite successful at this; I've made my model in
such a way that time based or touch order based attribution models
won't get the desired result.
</p>

<p>
You need to decide if the reason these models fail is realistic or if
it is just a product of my unrealistic assumptions.
