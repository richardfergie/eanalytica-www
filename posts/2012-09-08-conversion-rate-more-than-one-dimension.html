What is a good conversion rate? A famously naive question deserving
of the only reasonable answer; "it depends".
</p>

<p>
On what does it depend? On pretty much everything I think, but the
two biggest factors are, in my opinion:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The sector the site operates in and what the product is.
</li>
<li>The quality of traffic to the site. Sites with only brand traffic
will tend to have very high conversion rates compared to sites who
get most of their visits from display advertising even if they are
otherwise identical.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is the traffic quality dimension that I want to examine in this blog
post.
</p>

<p>
If the site owner is rational and goes after the easiest and highest
quality traffic first then as their website grows in terms of visits,
their conversions will look something like the following:
The above chart is a plot of the "square root rule" which I first heard
about from <a href="http://minethatdata.com">Kevin Hilstrom</a>. It states that for
many things, the return is proportional to the square root of the resources
put into it. So if I double the budget for any channel I can expect to get
about 1.4 times as much return (1.4 is close to the square root of 2).
</p>

<p>
If we plot the conversion rate instead of the number of conversions it looks like
this:
We see that as the number of visits increase, the conversion rate drops off
very rapidly. So is there any point in conversion rate optimisation when the
conversion rate will just drop off as the site grows?
</p>

<p>
There is a point to conversion rate optimisation; it changes the shape of the
curve rather than just a single number.
So conversion rate optimisation doesn't just change a single number at a particular
point in time. It improves the whole curve of potential conversion rates upwards.
</p>

<p>
The difference between the two curves might not look like much.
But even small changes in conversion rate can make a big difference to the total
number of conversions. Here are the conversion plots based on the conversion rates
from above:
Wow!
</p>

<p>
So to sum up: When talking about conversion rate optimisation, it is not a single
number to be improved, instead it is a curve that you are trying to change the
shape of.
</p>

<p>
(If you looked at it in full detail and tried to take into account other variables
it would end up being a many dimensional hyper surface. But my point still stands)
