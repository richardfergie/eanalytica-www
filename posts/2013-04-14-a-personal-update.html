<p>
Over the last few months I think I've been having my quarter life
crisis (this bodes well for my longevity). I felt the need to make a
change but I couldn't figure out what change to make. I'm a fan of
running the occasional off the wall test for websites - especially
when you don't really know what to do next. So I decided to apply
this advice to my personal life.

<p>
I'm writing this from Quito, Ecuador. An opportunity came up to do
some short term travelling in South America and I decided to turn it
into more of a long term thing. I don't have a return flight booked.
</p>

<p>
How does this feel? Both awesome and lonely.
</p>

<p>
Onto more practical matters - to support my lifestyle as a digital
nomad I am available to take on short projects within my areas of
expertise. 
</p>

<p>
I would summarise these as:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Paid search.
</li>
<li>Analysis of web analytics data
</li>
<li>Analysis of other data
</li>
<li>Technical implementation of web analytics
</li>
<li>On site search engine optimisation
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you would like my help in any of these areas (or think I could
help you in some other way) then please get in touch:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.eanalytica.com/contact">Website contact form</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/richardfergie">@RichardFergie</a>
</li>
<li><a href="mailto:fergie@eanalytica.com">By email</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see, I like to think of my expertise as reaching
(slightly) beyond just paid search. Which is why I've changed the
address of this website from PPCAnalytica.com to <a href="http://www.eanalytica.com">EAnalytica.com</a>.
