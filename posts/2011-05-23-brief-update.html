        I have changed jobs. My new workplace has an internal tool that is very similar to the one I was working on here. Because of this I will no longer be working on my own set of PPC Tools
    </p>

    <p>The summary says pretty much everything.</p><p>I have open sourced some of the code I was working on at <a href="https://github.com/ppcanalytica/AdWords-to-PostgreSQL" target="_blank">https://github.com/ppcanalytica/AdWords-to-PostgreSQL</a>. There is enough there to get AdWords data into an SQL database. Documentation is terrible; I hope to add to it over the next few weeks, probably in the form of further blog posts on here.</p>
