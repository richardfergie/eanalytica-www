<p>
I am a big fan of Kevin Hillstrom and his
<a href="http://blog.minethatdata.com">Mine That Data blog</a>. Back in October he published an example path to
purchase and asked for comments on how people would attribute
it. <a href="http://blog.minethatdata.com/2012/10/your-opinion-wanted-attribution.html">Go
read the post</a>, the comments are quite interesting.
</p>

<p>
The user journey in question is as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Customer receives a catalog on October 1.
</li>
<li>Customer receives email campaign on October 2.
</li>
<li>Customer receives email campaign on October 4.
</li>
<li>Customer visits site on October 5 via paid search, branded term.
</li>
<li>Customer visits your mobile website on an iPad on October 6 via
affiliate website, purchases item featured in October 1 catalog,
uses free shipping promo code from affiliate website.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kevin has also created three personas which are useful to understand
how different generations shop these days. The three personas are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="http://blog.minethatdata.com/2012/01/ladies-and-gentlemen-meet-judy.html">Judy</a>, an older women who prefers to shop by catalogue and who
doesn't really engage with a lot of modern marketing
</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.minethatdata.com/2012/01/ladies-and-gentlemen-meet-jennifer.html">Jennifer</a>, who loves using search and affiliates to find a great
bargain
</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.minethatdata.com/2012/01/ladies-and-gentlemen-meet-jasmine.html">Jasmine</a>, who is much younger than the others. Her shopping habits
are more likely to revolve around mobile and social.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
You should read Kevin's summaries of the three personas because I
haven't really gone into much detail.
</p>

<p>
It occurred to me the other day that how credit for distributing an
order should be distributed depends a lot on who the order is made by.
</p>

<p>
If the above purchase path is from Judy then the catalogue should get
more credit because we know that this is important to Judy.
</p>

<p>
For Jennifer, it is the free shipping promo code that should get the
credit because we know that Jennifer loves free shipping.
</p>

<p>
For Jasmine, I am not sure how to credit the order because (to my
mind) non of the channels featured are particularly
Jasmine-ish. Perhaps this path would never happen for a Jasmine?
</p>

<p>
For long, fairly unique, paths like in the example this approach
probably won't make much difference; each path is probably indicative
of a particular persona. For shorter paths that are conceivably be
taken by more than one persona I think that attributing the sale based
on what we know motivates the person could be a useful way of seeing
what is actually driving a conversion.
</p>

<p>
This approach depends on two things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Having good personas that actually reflect the audience for a
website
</li>
<li>Being able to accurately assign a customer into a persona segment
</li>
</ol>

<p>
My guess is that parts one and two will both be beyond most businesses
so they'll have to stick with always attributing the same conversion
path in the same way.
