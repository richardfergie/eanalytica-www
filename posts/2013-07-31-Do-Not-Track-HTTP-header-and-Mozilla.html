<p>
There is an interesting <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858839">bug report and associated discussion</a> over on
the Mozilla bugzilla which reveals several points about the Do Not
Track HTTP header, the Mozilla website and Firefox's implementation
of this protocol.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is confusion about what "Do Not Track" actually means; some
say it means "don't track me at all", others say the meaning is
more "don't track me and share the data with third parties"
</li>
<li>There is also discussion about whether or not Google Analytics
counts as a third party. The opinion seems to be that because
Mozilla use GA Premium the data will not be used by Google so using
GA does not count as giving the data to a third party.
</li>
<li>Finally, there are people making (the very valid imo) point that
the Firefox interface for DNT is terrible at making these
ambiguities obvious to the user:
<img src="./files/firefox-dnt.png" alt="firefox-dnt.png" />
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I messed around with the DNT header when I first saw the setting in
Firefox and I was amused to see that the Google Analytics tracking
pixel was still firing. I thought this was either because they would
filter the DNT requests when processing the data or because Google
deliberately chose to ignore the header. I never considered that
being tracked by Google in this way could actually be compliant with
DNT; in some ways this is worse because it makes the protocol
basically useless
