title: Cobb Douglas and Agency Fees
---
<p>
    Regular readers will know I'm a big fan of the "square root rule" which is a
    quick rule of thumb to calculate the diminishing returns from increasing
    media spend.
</p>
<p>
    The square root rule says
    $$ Y \propto \sqrt{X} $$
    where $Y$ is the output (e.g. conversions) and $X$ is the input (e.g. media
    spend).
</p>
<p>
    This tells you that, as a rough rule of thumb, doubling your media spend
    will increase conversions by a factor of $$\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4$$ or 40%.
</p>
<p>
    The rule is never perfectly accurate but it is a pretty good approximation
    when you don't know very much about a channel.
</p>
<p>
    I first heard about it from <a href="http://minethatdata.com">Kevin
    Hillstrom</a> and the PPC nerds at the Rimm Kaufmann group (RIP to what was
    once a great blog - I can't find the old posts since they got taken over).
</p>
<p>
    It is also a special case of a <a
                                           href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb%E2%80%93Douglas_production_function">Cobb
    Douglas production function</a>
    because it uses a power law to model diminishing returns. In this post I
    want to expand on other aspects of Cobb-Douglas with a potential application
    to media/agency life.
</p>
<p>
    The Cobb Douglas model is
    $$ Y = KL^{\alpha}C^{\beta} $$
    where $Y$ is the total output, $L$ is the labour input, $C$ is the capital
    input and $\alpha$, $\beta$ are the "output elasticities". $K$ is a constant
    that is sometimes referred to as "productivity".
</p>
<p>
    This is more complicated than the square root rule because it has two
    inputs (labour and capital) rather than just one (media spend).
</p>
<p>
    The obvious way (to me!) to extend this approach to media buying it to look
    at the inputs in terms of media spend (capital) and agency fees (labour).
</p>
<p>
    Then the profitability of a campaign is
    $$ P = KL^{\alpha}C^{\beta} - L - C $$
</p>
<p>
    When is profitability maximised?
</p>
<p>
    Let's make things slightly simpler by looking for the optimum fee as a
    <em>percentage</em> of the total input. i.e. $L+C=1$. Then the equation
    simplifies to
    $$ P = K(1-C)^{\alpha}C^{\beta} -1 $$
</p>
<p>
    Differentiating
    $$ \frac{dP}{dC} = -K(1-C)^{\alpha-1}C^{\beta-1}(\alpha C + \beta (C-1)) $$
    (thanks Wolfram Alpha!)
</p>
<p>
    There are three zeros for this function:
    <ol>
        <li>$C=1$ i.e. all input is spend on media, zero on fees and the output
            is (of course) 0.</li>
        <li>$C=0$ i.e. all input is spent on fees and zero on media. The output
            is (of course) 0.</li>
        <li>$\alpha C + \beta (C-1) = 0$. This is the interesting one where
            profit is maximised.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    A quick rearrangement of the third equation shows that profit is maximised
    when
    $$C = \frac{\beta}{\alpha+\beta}$$
</p>
<p>
    Remember that $\beta$ is the elasticity of media spend which, in my
    experience, is usually around 0.5. Plugging that into the above equation and
    simplifying gives
    $$ C = \frac{1}{2 \alpha + 1} $$
</p>
<p>
    I have <strong>no idea</strong> what the value of $\alpha$ should be. If we
    assume that a 10% media fee is optimal (BIG if) then this implies that
    $$ \alpha = 0.05 $$
</p>
<p>
    In practical terms, this predicts that doubling an agency fee without any
    change in media spend would increase output by a factor of
    $$\sqrt[20]{2} \approx 1.04$$
    or 4%.
</p>
<p>
    This seems low to me.

<h3>Update</h3>
<p><a
       href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/135048595357249?journalCode=rael20">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/135048595357249?journalCode=rael20</a>
    mentions the following:
    <blockquote>
        Output-labour elasticities varied from a low of 0.18 for tobacco to a high of 0.70 for apparel
    </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
    This would imply that the optimum agency fee percentage would be between 35%
    and 72% assuming the output elasticity is somewhere between the two extremes
    of apparel and tobacco.
</p>
<p>
    This seems high to me.
