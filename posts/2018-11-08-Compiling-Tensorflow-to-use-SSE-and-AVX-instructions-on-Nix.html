title: Compiling Tensorflow to use SSE and AVX instructions on NixOS
---
<p>
    When you install Tensorflow in the normal way you will often get a warning
    message like <em>"The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.2
    instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU
    computations"</em> or something like that.
</p>
<p>
    This tells you that the Tensorflow computations could be optimised further
    but these optimisations aren't used by default because they are only
    available on some CPU architectures.
</p>
<p>
    Tensorflow has a guide on how to <a
                                         href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source">install
    from source</a> with these features enabled but the process is tedious and
    it is not the Nix way.
</p>
<p>
    If you look at the <a
                           href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/python-modules/tensorflow/default.nix#L92:L95">Nix
    derivation for tensorflow</a> you can see options for enabling SSE4.2, AVX2
    and FMA support; the question is "how do I enable these in my own
    decleration?"
</p>
<p>
    Here is an extract from the old version of my nix file:
    <code><pre>
pythonPackageList = python-packages: with python-packages; [
    pandas
    scikitlearn
    Keras
    tensorflow
    numpy
    h5py
    scipy
    jupyter
    conda
    statsmodels
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    nltk
    beautifulsoup4
    flask
    psycopg2
    ];
  python3packages = pkgs.python3.withPackages pythonPackageList;
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    All we need to do is change the <code>tensorflow</code> variable to be what
    we want it to be:
    <code><pre>
 python3PackageOverrides = pkgs.python3Packages.override (oldAttrs:
     { overrides = self: super: {
         tensorflow = super.tensorflow.override {
           sse42Support = true;
           avx2Support = true;
           fmaSupport = true;
           };
         };
       });

  pythonPackageList = python-packages: with python-packages; [
    pandas
    scikitlearn
    Keras
    python3PackageOverrides.tensorflow
    numpy
    h5py
    scipy
    jupyter
    conda
    statsmodels
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    nltk
    beautifulsoup4
    flask
    psycopg2
    ];
  python3packages = pkgs.python3.withPackages pythonPackageList;
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    Simple! <small>When you know how...</small>
</p>
<p>
    I don't notice significant speedups with this change, but it does mean I
    don't get the warning message any more. Disabling the warning messages would
    probably have been easier.
</p>
