        <p>I always find it difficult to describe what I do; as a freelance consultant I'll do pretty much anything if the price is right.</p>
        <p>Businesses <em>mostly</em> pay me for my data analysis skills, particularly with a focus on paid search marketing. I know more about data
            science than most PPC experts and I know a lot more about PPC than most data scientists.</p>
        <h3>Example Projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Using machine learning to identify different customer segments for a large online publisher.</li>
            <li>Setting up experiments to rigourously measure the incremental uplift of brand search.</li>
            <li>Helping agencies by writing AdWords scripts to automate parts of the measure &rarr; learn &rarr; apply cycle.</li>
            <li>Modelling the true incremental value of marketing spend for a luxury hotel.</li>
            <li>Building custom analysis tools and dashboards for a large manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Personalised training sessions on machine learning, the R programming language and PPC strategy <small>(not all at the same time!)</small></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You might be wondering why I don't list PPC account management here. My account management services are relatively expensive for a solo
            practicioner which means they are only suitable for quite a small niche; for this kind of relationship to work well for you, the business
            needs to be big enough that I can make enough difference to give you a good return on my fee yet small enough that I am able to manage the
            account by myself.</p>
        <p>If you think this might be you, then we should definitely chat.</p>

        <p>A curated selection of the best content on the site:</p>
        <div class="greatest_hit">
        <h4><a href="/r-for-web-analysts/">R for Web Analysts</a></h4>
        <p>A soup to nuts guide for getting started with the R programming language and Google Analytics.</p>
        <p>I provide customised training for organisations to help develop the contents of this document towards a particular business need.</p>

        <h4><a href="/multi-level-bidding/">Multi Level Bidding</a></h4>
        <p>One of the challenges of biddable media is setting the correct bid based on not very much data.</p>
        <p>This page demonstrates one approach to helping with this which uses the account structure to "pool" data together which gives a better estimate of the conversion rate.</p>
        <p>The hierarchical model approach can also be used in other ways.</p>

        <h4><a href="/lines-of-best-fit/">Lines of Best Fit</a></h4>
        <p>A very simple introduction to adapting machine learning models for custom use</p>
        <p>Another example of how this can be useful is my post on <a href="/different-test-models/">different test models</a></p>
