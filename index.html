                Hello, my name is Richard Fergie.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an independent Data Science Consultant.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can help you build new analytical capabilities within your team through training and building tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have an idea for a way to use data or machine learning within your business then I will develop a proof of concept to help demonstrate the value of your idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many people don't have a specific ideas for what to do with all their data. Why not get in touch anyway? We can discuss what I've done on previous projects and see if there is something that might fit with your business.

        <h3>Greatest Hits</h3>
        <p>A curated selection of the best content on the site:</p>
        <div class="greatest_hit">
        <h4><a href="/r-for-web-analysts/">R for Web Analysts</a></h4>
        <p>A soup to nuts guide for getting started with the R programming language and Google Analytics.</p>
        <p>I provide customised training for organisations to help develop the contents of this document towards a particular business need.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="greatest_hit">
        <h4><a href="/multi-level-bidding/">Multi Level Bidding</a></h4>
        <p>One of the challenges of biddable media is setting the correct bid based on not very much data.</p>
        <p>This page demonstrates one approach to helping with this which uses the account structure to "pool" data together which gives a better estimate of the conversion rate.</p>
        <p>The hierarchical model approach can also be used in other ways.</p>

        <div class="greatest_hit">
        <h4><a href="/lines-of-best-fit/">Lines of Best Fit</a></h4>
        <p>A very simple introduction to adapting machine learning models for custom use</p>
        <p>Another example of how this can be useful is my post on <a href="/different-test-models/">different test models</a></p>
