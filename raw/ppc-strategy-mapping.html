        <h1>Using Maps as a Tool for PPC Strategy</h1>
        <p>I recently started following <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley">@swardley</a> on Twitter</p>
        <p>In his tweets he expresses many of my misgivings about how "strategy" is done (or
            not done) except that rather than just moaning about how everyone senior to me is
            an idiot - he has a solution.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">... maps are fundamentally a communication and learning tool, a way of describing a context and learning from one to another ...</p>&mdash; swardley (@swardley) <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/659332704715079680">October 28, 2015</a></blockquote>
        <p>
            Here a "map" is not something related to geography - it might be better to think
            of it as a 2D simplification of the real world. Two might be the wrong number of
            dimensions here; maps have symbols and colours on them too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever. That isn't the point
        </p>
        <p>
            Wardley likes to use how visible something is to consumers as one axis and how
            evolved/developed a component is as the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            I might return to Wardley mapping later. For now, the important observation is
            that if you know where you are on a map you can tell what is around you and
            where you might want to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            This differs from a common approach to strategy which is to start with figuring
            out a goal or purpose. Without knowing where you start from this is meaningless.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every little girl can stamp her foot and say "I want a pony!" And every business
            can make a lofty sounding yet vacuous statement of purpose which dissolves as
            soon as they evaluate their current position and realise the only important thing
            is survival.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enough with the hatred for strategy consultants. <small>I will try not to do any
            more of this.</small> How can we use this in PPC?
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing is to figure out what axes to use. What is out North/South? And
            what is our East/West?
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is my first go at this - let's see if anything interesting pops out the other
            end:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The y-axis will be how developed the account is. With "not even started"
                    at the bottom and "extremely sophisticated" at the top. Vague terms, but
                    perhaps useful enough to be going on with.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The x-axis will be how performance is measured with "direct response" on
                    the left and what I'm going to call a "holistic" approach on the right.
                    The holistic approach is meant to encompass direct response plus branding
                    or something like that.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <small>Feel free to use this yourself</small>
        <img src="/files/base.png"/>
        <p>
            Now we can begin to play around:
        </p>
        <img src="/files/google-wants.png">
        <p>
            Google wants people to be using their platform for brand <strong>and</strong>
            direct response.
        </p>
        <p>
            They probably don't want people to be incredibly sophisticated direct response
            advertisers because once people get into measuring incrementality and profitablity
            their spend drops a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would believe that this is true of the most sophisticated brand advertisers as
            well but I don't know enough to say for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discussion on the specific location aside, being in that general area (top right
            quadrant) is good for advertisers too. How do they get there?
        </p>
        <img src="/files/advertiser-routes.png">
        <p>
            Of course, not everyone has to start in the bottom left corner.
        </p>
        <img src="/files/starting.png">
        <p>
            I currently have a client in the following situation:
        </p>
        <img src="/files/options.png">
        <p>
            My preferred path is partly because this puts them on the proven road of starting
            with direct response and then when this starts to suffer from diminishing
            returns moving across to branding. AdWords works really well on this path with
            companies getting comfortable with the platform where it is strongest before moving
            into more uncertain territory.
        </p>
        <p>
            This raises a tonne of questions about what is the optimal route. I am sure it
            is possible to straight from where the client is into the top right corner. And
            I am sure it is possible to head "due North" as their plans seem to require.
            But I feel that I can move them very quickly up and to the left after which they
            will be making a lot more money. The focus on developing both brand and direct
            response tactics is spreading me rather thin.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make another analogy with a geographic map - the shortest route isn't
            necessarily the fastest.
        </p>
        <p>
            We should put these barriers on the map so that it is obvious
            that we have to navigate around them.
        </p>
        <img src="/files/barrier1.png">
        <p>
            Don't get me wrong, I think this barrier is hard to cross
            wherever/whenever you try and do it. But there are advantages
            to crossing higher up. i.e. do direct response first and then
            move into branding:
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a skills gap in AdWords. Most practicioners
            are better at direct response. Anyone who is good at
            branding can do more interesting things. Unsophisticated
            accounts are unlikely to have the broad range of skills
            required to run both direct response <strong>and</strong>
            branding.
        </p>
        <p>
            So on the margin, it is better to hire another direct
            response guy than a PPC branding expert (do such people exist?).
            When this stops being true, it is time to cross the wall.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the above is really just me reaching into the excuse bag. Doing (and
            particularly measuring/being accountable for) brand stuff is outside of
            my comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The advantage of a map is that I can use it to outline where my comfort
            zone is:
        </p>
        <img src="/files/comfort-zone.png">
        <p>
            And say what areas I am interested in developing:
        </p>
        <img src="/files/areas-for-growth.png">
        <p>
            So far, this does not seem to be giving us much actionable insight. Perhaps
            that is to be expected; if I can provide you with PPC strategy in some generic
            blog post where I know nothing about your business then you really need to
            up your game.
        </p>
        <p>
            But it does give us a way of expressing context which is often useful. Let's
            see how it helps with the oft repeated question "how should I charge clients?"
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a great deal of disagreement on this inthe #ppcchat community with the
            pnly items of consensus being:
            <ol>
                <li>There is no one size fits all solution</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three main ways of costing a project:
            <ul>
                <li>Cost based on the amount of time it will take</li>
                <li>Cost based on a percentage of the media spend</li>
                <li>Cost based on performance (normally a percentage of profit or similar)</li>
            </ul>
            Here is my map showing when I think each is appropriate:
        </p>
        <img src="/files/billing.png">
        <p>
            "Pay for time" is best suited for smaller, simpler projects where the link between
            "I do a good job" and "the client invests more money" is uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Percentage of spend deals are perfect where the link between "I do a good job"
            and "the client invests more money" is very strong. As can be seen from the map,
            this covers a great deal of the available space which is probably why this kind
            of cost structure is so common.
        </p>
        <p>
            But as direct response advertisers get more sophisticated the link between "I
            do a good job" and "the client invests more money" is broken again - indeed, part
            of what doing a good job means for these clients is to advise them when their
            returns have diminished so much that the marginal return is negative.
        </p>
        <p>
            I doubt this will end the debate forever, but I think it does demonstrate how
            a map can add useful context for "it depends" type answers.
        </p>
        <p>
            So to answer the "how should I charge?" question for my business I look at
            where on the map my clients are and where they would like to go (or where
            I wish they would like to go!):
        </p>
        <img src="/files/movement.png">
        <p>
            Right now I mostly charge clients a day rate or a fixed project cost.
            This map shows that I should switch to percentage of spend.
